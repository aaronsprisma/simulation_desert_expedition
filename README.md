simulation_desert_expedition
============================

Program which predicts the amount of food and drink that a team 
must take to a 50 day expedition at the Atacama Desert during 
the months of July and August.

It takes an integer number (n) for the number of iterations that 
you whould like the program to execute. Each iteration will generate
the simulation of a different expedition.

Consequently, this code returns 'n' files which contain the set of 
data and particular table of events of each simulation.
